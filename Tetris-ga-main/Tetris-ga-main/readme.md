## Introduction

Tetris Game AI is a project that combines the classic game of Tetris with artificial intelligence. The AI player learns to play Tetris by evolving a population of strategies using a genetic algorithm.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Genetic algorithm-driven AI player
- Evolving strategies for optimal gameplay
- Interactive and visually appealing interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dokhanhnam1199/Tetris-ga.git
    cd Tetris-ga
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the trainning program:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

## Usage

- Use arrow keys to move and rotate Tetris pieces.
- Watch the AI player evolve and improve over time.
- Enjoy the game or let the AI play for you!

## Genetic Algorithm

The genetic algorithm works by evolving a population of strategies for playing Tetris. Each strategy is represented as a set of genes, and the fittest strategies are selected for reproduction in each generation. Over time, the AI player learns to make better decisions and achieve higher scores.
